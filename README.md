# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch project from Odin Project

The aim of the project is to create an etch-a-sketch-like interactive interface. 

It provides users with a grid of boxes that change color as the cursor hovers over them. Includes a feature that allows users to reset the grid, giving the option to choose the dimensions of the grid with a maximum of 100 x 100.

A key point of the project was to use loops and DOM manipulation where possible to keep the html file clean, and automating code that would have otherwise been repetitive and bloated.
